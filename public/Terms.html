        <h1 class=termsh> TERMS AND CONDITIONS </h1> 
        <p class="termsp">
        The Weapons Vault is a collection of digital artworks (NFTs) running on the Ethereum network.
        This website is only an interface allowing participants to exchange digital collectibles.
        Users are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private Ethereum wallets and validating all transactions
        and contracts generated by this website before approval. 
        Furthermore, as the Weapons Vault smart contract runs on the Ethereum network, there is no ability to undo, reverse, or
        restore any transactions.
        This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind. 
        By using this website you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving The Weapons Vault digital collectibles.
        </p>

       <h1 class=termsh> OWNERSHIP </h1> 
       <p class= "termsp"> 
        <em>Own the NFT</em>. Each Vault is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.
         When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Weapon, the Art, completely. 
        Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, 
        or otherwise modify the ownership of any Weapons Vault.
        <br/> <br/> 
        <em>Personal Use</em>. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, BRUVS CAPITAL LLC grants you a worldwide,
        royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art,
        along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: 
        (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; 
        (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Weapons Vault / NFT,
        provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Weapons owner’s rights to display the Art for their Weapons
        to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or 
        (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, 
        or participation of your Weapons, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Weapons
        owner’s rights to display the Art for their Weapons to ensure that
        only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Weapons eaves the website/application.
        <br/><br/> 
        <em>Commercial Use</em>. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, BRUVS CAPITAL LLC grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the 
        purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”).
        Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce ands sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in
        this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of Weapons generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically
        verifies each Weapons owner’s rights to display the Art for their Weapons to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or
        application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of Weapons generally, provided that the third party website
        or application cryptographically verifies each Weapons owner’s rights to display the Art for their Weapons to ensure that 
        only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the
        Purchased Weapon leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.
        </p>
